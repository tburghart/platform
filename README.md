### #include "platform.h"

This is simply a standalone repo to hold the canonical "platform.h" include
file I use in assorted projects.

The file has comments, and the `defs.sh` script (on Unix-y systems)
generates some `platform_defs.h` files to show you what will be defined
when it's included with various compiler options.
